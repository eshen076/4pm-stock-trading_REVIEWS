Present from 4pm-stock trading: Eric(reviewee), Sean(reviewee helper), Wesley, Shirlyn, Andrew, and Frank. (Every member of the group). Present from 6pm-stock trading: Maxton Ginier as Reviewer. We were not told that we would need another member of our group as a helper, and since we were working between two sections, it wasn't possible to get another member over.

Max found that we had a home page with several stocks listed, a way to search through them and a page with a graph corresponding to the stock. Max liked the layout but thought we could improve on making the navbar more consistent. Also felt like we could put a date on stocks page.

On the Kanban board Max found three user stories in the MVP that allowed the user to navigate through the app, view stock information and see a list of available stocks. 

Max found our readme description was in good shape and allowed him to run the code.

Max felt we could add more features like a date, sorting for the stocks, and make navbars consistent on all pages.
