Present from 4pm-stock trading: Eric(reviewee), Sean(reviewee helper), Wesley, Shirlyn, Andrew, and Frank. (Every member of the group).
Present from 6pm-stock trading: Maxton Ginier as Reviewer. We were not told that we would need another member of our group as a helper, and since we were working between two sections, it wasn't possible to get another member over.

I really enjoyed the UI of the stock layout. I think it was very cool how you laid them out in a table. It made looking for stocks very easy.
Especially with the search feauture.

I think what could be improved is the consistency of the navigation bar on top, and also I think a cool feature would be to add a navigation bar to sort the different stock options in the table.

The kanban board was completely done when I saw it last. So my suggestion during the review lab was to mark everything as done and move it over to get new issues started.

The readme file looked good according to the readme standard we did in class. Nothing was out of place on it, and it was pretty easy to follow along.

I really enjoyed the design of the webapp. I think the next steps to take are getting it linked up to an API (rather than having static data), and it'll be in great shape!
The most impactful opportunity for improvement would definitely have to be the navbar. Fix that up consistently between templates and it'll look very smooth.
